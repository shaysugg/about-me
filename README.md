*iOS developer, coding with Swift, always looking forward to learn new stuff!*

## About Me

Graduated with hardware engineer degree from Semnan university. I started to learn swift at 2017. In the middle of 2018 I released my first app: Yadavar, a simple to-do list app with highly customized UI which use Shamsi calendar. Soon later I started my second project, ComicKhan: an app for reading and organize comic files in iPhone and iPad. It‚Äôs been my main personal project since then and trying to keep it updated and getting it better day by day. In the middle of the 2020 I got hired by a client and started to build their app, Rewardo: an iOS client app, back-ended by a server for creating and participating in challenges and quizzes.

üõ†Technologies that been used: `Swift`, `CoreData`, `MVC` ,`FileManager`, `XCTest`, `CocoaPods`

### ‚úÖ Things that I learned:

* More advance CoreData: using NSfetchResultController to automatically commit CoreData changes into UI,
Learn how to use CoreData relations between entities. How to rewrite the CoreData stack from scratch that use in memory storage for testing purposes. How to use ValueTransformer to store custom NSObjects in CoreData.

* How to work with FileManager: create directories, copy and paste files, get directory contents, ‚Ä¶

* What is MVC and how to use it for separating your logic codes from your view codes and write your logic into separated classes that makes testing much easier.

* Basic usage of XCTests for writing unit tests.

* How to build a whole ViewController UI programmatically without using storyboards.

* How to build a responsive UI which renders differently based on device is iPhone or iPad its rotation.

* How to use CocoaPods to install libraries that I need for unarchiving ZIP and RAR files.

* How to publish an app on the Appstore.

### üò¨ Challenges:

* NSFetchResultController sectioning and sorting based on entity relations sometimes not working, and It‚Äôs a little bit limited for sorting based on multiple factors.

* Understanding the CoreData stack and how its components related together.

* Learning How to use memory graph for resolving memory issues.

* How to build an iOS app from 0 to 100
* Basic use of storyBoard for adding UI elements to screen and then highly customise storyboard elements with code
* Basic knowledge of how using CoreData. fetching with NSfetchRequest, filtering with NSpredicate and lightweight migration.
* How to use local notification. set and trigger them programmatically.

### üò¨ Challenges:
* Don‚Äôt know enough about MVC then. So codebase became a little bit messy and hard to maintain and update.

* Avoid writing unnecessary constraint setup codes by using StackViews.

* How to use SwiftPackageManager to install libraries instead CocoaPods.
